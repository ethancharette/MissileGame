Game built by Ethan Charette in Feb 2025 in two days.

All assets, other than particle effects, are made by me!

This is an endless "bullet hell" sorta game where you control a missile and have to dodge Hazards.

HAZARDS
Asteroid - A grey block that deals damage and explodes when it collides with the player
Red Asteroid - A red asteroid that explodes prior to player collision, scattering it's rocks about. If the player collides with these rocks they take damage

INTERACTABLES
Worm Hole - The worm hole hides the player for a certain amount of time, sheilding them from oncoming damage but disabling their movement while invisible.

CURRENT BUILD
Worm Holes have a chance of spawning every 20 seconds, but in the current build it is set to 100% for the sake of testing
